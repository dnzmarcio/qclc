\title{Upper Control Limits for Exponentially Weighted Moving Average}
\usage{
upper_limit_ewma(t, mu, sigma2, L)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{An integer vector; representing a sequence from 1 to 
n, where n denotes the number of observations used in the Exponential 
Weighted Moving Average. \code{t} is denoted by \code{i} in the UCL formula. 
See Details for more information.}

\item{mu}{double; process mean. Also known as the target mean or the average of the historical data.}

\item{sigma2}{double: variance of the EWMA statistic.}

\item{L}{A numeric value; the control limit factor. \code{L} represents the width of 
the control limits in terms of multiples of the standard deviation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the EWMA Upper Control Limits.
}
\description{
\code{upper_limit_ewma} is used to generate the Upper Control Limits for the EWMA 
quality control charts.
}
\details{
The choice of \code{L} affects the chart's ability to detect process shifts; 
larger L values set wider control limits from the center line, reducing false alarms but also 
potentially delaying the detection of real shifts.
The UCL of the EWMA is given by:
\deqn{UCL(Z_i) = Z_0 + L \sqrt{\sigma^2(Z_i)}}
}
\examples{
x = rnorm(100)
aux = control_parm_ewma(x, lambda = 0.15, 
max.rl = 500)
upper_limit_ewma(t = 1:length(x), mu = aux$mu, 
sigma2 = aux$sigma2, L = 3)
