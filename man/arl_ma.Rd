\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of individual observations obtained from the process.
In some cases, \code{x} can also indicate sample averages according to a specified sampling plan.}

\item{mu}{double; process mean. Also known as the target mean or the average of the historical data.}

\item{sigma2}{double; estimate of the process variance.}

\item{omega}{integer; the weighting factor of MA charts.}

\item{L}{A numeric value or vector. \code{L} is a control limit factor; represents 
the width of the control limits in terms of multiples of the standard deviation.}

\item{max.rl}{integer; Maximum Run Length. It refers to the total number of 
observations to be collected from \code{x} in each process replicate.}

\item{rl}{integer; Run Length of interest. It indicates the number of observations to detect an out-of-control condition.}

\item{scenario}{A logical evaluating to 0 or 1 indicating whether the process is under control \code{scenario} = 0, or the process out of control \code{scenario} = 1.}

\item{nboot}{integer; number of simulations to generate the process replicates.}

\item{ncores}{integer; number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing.}

\item{seed}{integer; to initialize the Random Number Generator to a known state.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame containing the Operating Characteristics for MA charts. 
The data frame includes the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{L}: Control Limit Factor.
  \item \code{ARL}: Average Run Length. See Details for more information about ARL0 and ARL1.
  \item \code{FP}: False Positive rate, representing the frequency of false alarms when the process is in control. 
  \item \code{TP}: True Positive rate, indicating the rate of correctly detecting a shift when the process is actually out of control.
}
}
\description{
\code{arl_ma()} returns estimates of the Operating Characteristics for the 
the Moving Average quality control charts through bootstrap sampling.
}
\details{
\code{ARL} is the expected Run Length \code{rl} generated by \code{arl_ewma}. 
When the process is under control \code{scenario = 0}, Average Run Length is denoted as
\code{ARL0} and \code{FP} is returned. If the process is out of control 
\code{scenario = 1}, Average Run Length is used as \code{ARL1} and \code{TP} is 
returned. 

\code{ARL0} and \code{ARL1} refer to the expected number of observations to 
detect an out-of-control condition. When the process is under control, a high \code{ARL0} is 
preferred as it demonstrates that the chart does not react excessively to regular 
variations within process limits, thus minimizing false alarms. Conversely, a low \code{ARL1} 
is desirable because it signifies that the chart is adequately sensitive, 
enabling quick detection and response to actual deviations in the process. This 
increases the true positive rate, hence the power of the quality control charts.
