\title{Moving Average statistic}
\usage{
ma_statistic(x, t, omega)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of individual observations obtained from the process.
In some cases, \code{x} can also indicate sample averages according to a specified sampling plan.}

\item{t}{An integer vector; representing a sequence from 1 to 
n, where n denotes the number of observations used in the Moving Average.}

\item{omega}{integer; the weighting factor of MA charts, also known as the window size.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of Moving average statistics.
}
\description{
\code{ma_statistic()} calculates moving averages for a provided time series vector, 
using a defined window size.
}
\details{
The moving average statistic is given by:
\deqn{Z_i = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{\omega} \sum_{j=t[i]-\omega+1}^{t[i]} x_j & t[i] \geq \omega \\\\
\frac{1}{t[i]} \sum_{j=1}^{t[i]} x_j & t[i] < \omega
\end{array}
\right.}

where \code{t[i]} is the observation index at time \code{i}, \eqn{\omega} is the weighting factor
\code{omega}, also known as the window size, on which averages are calculated, 
and \code{x_j} is the individual observation of the process \code{x} at time \code{j}.
}
\examples{
x = rnorm(100)
ma_values <- ma_statistic(x, t = 1:length(x), omega = 10)
print(ma_values)
