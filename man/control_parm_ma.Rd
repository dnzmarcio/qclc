\title{Control parameters for the Moving Average (MA)}
\usage{
control_parm_ma(x, omega)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of individual observations obtained from the process.
In some cases, \code{x} can also indicate sample averages according to a specified sampling plan.}

\item{omega}{integer; the weighting factor of MA charts.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{mu}: The process mean. Also known as the target mean or the average of the historical data \code{x}.
  \item \code{sigma2}: The variance of MA statistic.
  \item \code{omega}: the weighting factor of MA charts.
}
}
\description{
\code{control_parm_ma} computes the essential parameters required for generating
the Operating Characteristics of MA quality control charts. It includes the process 
mean and the variance of MA statistic when the process is in control.
}
\details{
The Variance of the MA statistic \code{sigma2} is given by: 
\deqn{\sigma^2(t) = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll} 
\frac{\text{var}(x)}{n \cdot \omega} & t \geq \omega \\\\
\frac{\text{var}(x)}{n \cdot t} & \text{otherwise}
\end{array} 
\right.}
If \code{x} is provided as an input vector to \code{control_parm_ma()}, \code{n} is regarded as 1,
else \code{n} indicates number of columns of a given matrix.

The Process Mean \code{mu} is the average of the individual observations obtained from \code{X}:
\deqn{\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{n}X_j}{n}}
}
